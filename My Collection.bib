@article{Mitola1993,
abstract = {A software radio is defined as a set of digital signal processing (DSP) primitives, a metalevel system for combining the primitives into communication system functions (transmitter, channel model, receiver, etc.), and a set of target processors on which the software radio is hosted for real-time communications. The performance of enabling hardware technologies is related to software radio requirements, portending a decade of shift from hardware radios toward software intensive approaches. Computational models and architecture are discussed, stressing the need for topological consistency of radio functions and host architectures. A layered topology-oriented design approach encapsulated in a canonical open architecture software radio model is presented. The model provides a unified mathematical framework for quantitative analysis of algorithm structures, host architectures, and system performance for CAD.\&lt;\&gt;},
